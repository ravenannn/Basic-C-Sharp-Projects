These are some small applications and projects I worked on utilizing C# and .NET Framework.

## Projects

* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/ravenannn/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)


### Car Insurance
This project is a MVP web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user input
on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin
page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
